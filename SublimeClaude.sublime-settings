    // By default the 'claude-3-opus-latest' model is used. Note that the `-latest` alias point to
    // the most recent snapshot of a given model. Claude recommends using using specific model
    // versions (e.g., claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022) in production applications to ensure consistent
    // behavior.
    //
    // Note that a 'Claude: Switch Model' command exists that allows you to update the model that is
    // used on the fly via the command palette.
